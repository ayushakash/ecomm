### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd e-comm
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..

4. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/construction-ecommerce
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
